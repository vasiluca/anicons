# Anicons Library (BETA)
Import and use animated icons on your website! These animated icons are inspired by Google's Material Design.

You'll find a lot of examples on how to use Anicons in this [folder](./DEMO).

## How to use Anicons:
1. The best way to use the Anicons library is by importing it in your sass file:
```
@import link/to/anicons.sass

(code for your customized icons)
```
[Like we do here](./DEMO/with-sass/mystyles.sass)

2. Link to the compiled sass in your html file:
```
<link href="link/to/my-customized-icons.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```
[Like we do here.](./DEMO/with-sass/mypage.html)

3. Add the Anicon(s) into your html file:
```
<i class="anico menu close"></i>
```
[Like we do here.](./DEMO/with-sass/mypage.html)
