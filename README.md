# Anicons Library (BETA)
Import and use animated icons on your website! These animated icons are inspired by Google's Material Design.

You'll find all the files you need to make animated icons here.

### Importing anicons into your website:
```
<link href="link/to/anicons.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<script src="link/to/jquery"></script> <!-- Import jQuery before importing anicons.js file -->

<script src="link/to/anicons.js"></script>
```
